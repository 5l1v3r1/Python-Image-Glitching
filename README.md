# Python-Image-Glitching
Python script to destroy image files

Warning: this will destroy the file you specify so make sure to have a copy of the file before glitching.

# How to use:
Copy the filepath of the image you want to glitch to the "filepath" variable.
Note that if you use backslashes (\\), you need to escape them with a double backslash (\\\).

Then call the functions in any way you desire. If the image is a small file, use smaller numbers. Every function takes integers as parameters.

Enjoy!
