# Python-Image-Glitching
Python script to destroy image files in a (hopefully) artistic way.

Warning: this will destroy the file you specify so make sure to have a copy of the file before glitching.

# How to use:
Copy the filepath of the image you want to glitch to the "filepath" variable.
Note that if you use backslashes "\\", you need to escape them by using a double backslash instead "\\\\".

Then call the functions in any way you desire. If the image is a small file, use smaller numbers. Every function takes integers as parameters.

Examples of results can be found in the folder "Examples".

Enjoy!
